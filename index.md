My name is Damon Kelley and I am a software developer living in Denton, Texas.  I graduated from the University of North Texas back in the the Aughties.

**Some irrelevant things about me (aside from the above)**:

* I have two dogs that are named after Franklin D., and Eleanor Roosevelt.
* I am in a rock band. Go listen to our [latest album](https://voltrevolt.bandcamp.com/).
* I <i class="fa fw fa-heart-o"></i> craft beer.
* I suffered from [Phantom Vim Syndrome](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=phantom%20vim%20syndrome), but have since recovered (mostly).
* Despite my ailment, I still love and use Vim.
* I did Drum Corps once, which is only interesting to anyone else who has also done that.
* I like Apple's Menlo Typeface solely because the asterisks are centered vertically.
