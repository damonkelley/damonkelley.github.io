My name is Damon Kelley and I am a software developer living in Denton, Texas. I mostly work on web applications, usually in Django or Symfony2. I do some other stuff too, but I won't go into that now.


Feel free to follow me on twitter ([@damonkelley](http://twitter.com/damonkelley)) and checkout my [github](http://github.com/damonkelley) profile.
