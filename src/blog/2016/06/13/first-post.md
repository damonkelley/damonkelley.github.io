Today was the first day of my apprenticeship at 8th Light. I'll be using this blog to flesh out some of the ideas, principles, techniques, and bugs I encounter along the way.

As part of the apprenticeship, I will be reading a healthy amount of literature, and doing lots of coding. The first project on the docket is an unbeatable game of tic-tac-toe, which I will be implementing in Java.

Getting started is always the hardest part, so hopefully publishing this "first post" will help get the writing juices flowing. More to come.
