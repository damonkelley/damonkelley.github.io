### Beyond apprenticeship

I have had plenty to keep me busy over the last 5 months. As the apprenticeship has been winding down, I have started to plan my approach continuing my growth as a developer.

As of now I have three things that I would like to start or continue with after my apprenticeship ends.

1. **Blog 1-4 times a month**

    I have learned so much just by writing about something I don't know about or fully understand yet. I would like to keep that up, but I would like to spend a bit more time on each post to get them nice and polished, and fully fleshed out.

2. **Do a kata every day that I code**

    When I was studying music in college, I had a professor that would say "you should practice your instrument every day that you eat". I am going to adapt that a bit, and do a kata every day that I open my laptop to write code.

3. **Always have a technical book that I am working**

    Is there really anything to say about this one?
