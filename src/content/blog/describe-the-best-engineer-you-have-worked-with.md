> _Describe the best engineer you've worked with. Why were they so great? What
> made them special?_

Someone gave me this prompt recently, and it felt like great fodder for a
post. The prompt focuses on the engineer role specifically, but a few of
the qualities listed below are specific to engineering.

I have had the opportunity to work with several really great people, but
there is an archetype that sticks out for me. Below are the behaviors that this
archetype embodies.

**Strong opinions, weakly held**—They have views informed by their
experiences. They have seen what good looks like, and they can
see around corners. However, they know the value of the diversity of
experiences around them. It isn't about their idea; the goal is to find the
best one.

**They say, “*I don’t know.*"**—Feigning knowledge can lead to misaligned
expectations and miscommunication. The best engineers I've worked with will put
their ego aside and admit ignorance. This behavior sets an example for less
experienced team members and works to create a psychologically safe environment
for everyone.

**Amplify others and collaborate**—They are more than willing to put down their
work to help a teammate. Perhaps the teammate is blocked, or there is an
identified need to help them grow or onboard. They believe that personal
success comes through team success.

**Bias towards action**—They prototype and experiment to seek evidence over
debate and up-front analysis.

**Right tool for the job**—They don't seek a tool because it is shiny, but
because it fits the need.

**Simplicity**—They understand that complexity is a liability and work to find
the simplest solution for the opportunity at hand.

**Communication**—Not only are they skilled at communicating verbally and through
writing, but they also understand that code is a communication tool. They write
intention-revealing code for future readers and relentlessly create and modify
software to mirror domain concepts for users and/or the business.

**Value-centric mindset**—They understand it isn't about the output produced or
the shipped features. The goal is to deliver value. Sometimes, that might mean
less code, not more.

**"Non-traditional" backgrounds**—So many of the best engineers I have worked
with don't have a Computer Science degree; they were career changers.

**Seek alignment through selling ideas, not dictating requirements**—They are
human-centric and understand that they need alignment and buy-in to get the
best outcome.

**Preserving optionality through quality**—They understand the nature of product
development and the change that comes with it. They create cohesive
abstractions that can be composed, allowing the software to evolve in ways we
can't predict in the present. They know investments in quality can lead to big
payoffs in the future because of the flexibility it yields.
